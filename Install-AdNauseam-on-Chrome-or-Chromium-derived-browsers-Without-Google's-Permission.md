[Google has banned AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/free-adnauseam.html) from its web store and have left users with no access to their data.

### Back up your data

(if you're a new AdNauseam user jump to [Manual Install](#manual-install-in-developer-mode))

1. Click on the AdNauseam icon to open the AdNauseam menu
2. Click the ``SETTINGS`` button at the bottom of the menu
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click ``EXPORT ADS``

### Installation
### Manual install through `.crx`
**Note: this only works on certain Chromium-derived browsers, such as [Centbrowser](https://www.centbrowser.com/)**
1. Download the ``adnauseam.chrome.crx``file from the [latest release](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/latest).
2. Drag the ``adnauseam.chrome.crx``file into the active window of the browser 
### Manual Install in Developer Mode
1. Download the ``adnauseam.chromium.ZIP`` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/latest).
2. Extract the zip file to a folder somewhere that it can remain

###### Warning: Do not delete this folder after the install; Chrome will disable AdNauseam if this folder is not in the expected location

3. In your Chrome Browser menu, click Windows > Extensions or type ``chrome://extensions/`` in the address bar.
4. Check the ``Developer mode`` checkbox (see image)
5. Click the ``Load unpacked extension`` button (see image) and navigate to the file you downloaded in step 1 (in most cases it will be in the downloads folder).<br/>

*&nbsp;Note that each time you restart Chrome you will be prompted to ``Disable Developer Mode Extensions``. Feel free to simply hit ``Cancel`` and continue.<br/>

This is indeed annoying, as Google of course intends, however there is no workaround we know of at this time

### Retrieving your backup

1. After you have AdNauseam up and running again, go back to the AdNauseam settings page
1. Scroll all the way down again and click ''Import Ads''
1. Choose your backup
1. You're all set

### Using AdNauseam on other browsers

If __Google has lost your trust__, as it has ours, you might want to move to a browser that is not as intrusive and controlling. You have a number of options including:

* Go back to [Firefox](https://getfirefox.com), or a derivative like [WaterFox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/)
* You've always wanted to [give Opera a chance](https://opera.com), this is a good excuse
* Try one of the many non-Google versions of Chromium, such as:
 * [Comodo Dragon](https://www.comodo.com/home/browsers-toolbars/browser.php)
 * [Vivaldi](http://www.vivaldi.com/)
 * [Centbrowser](https://www.centbrowser.com/)
