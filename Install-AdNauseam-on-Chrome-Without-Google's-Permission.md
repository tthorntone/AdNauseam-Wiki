[Google has banned AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/free-adnauseam.html) from its web store and have left users with no access to their data; follow the instructions below for a workaround.

## Back up your data

_If you're a new AdNauseam user, or don't care about your saved ads, jump to [Installation](#install-adnauseam)_

1. Click on the AdNauseam icon to open the AdNauseam menu
2. Click the ``SETTINGS`` button at the bottom of the menu
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click ``EXPORT ADS``

## Install AdNauseam

_The following instructions are for Google Chrome only. For other chromium-based browsers simply download [the latest .CRX file](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/latest) and drag into your browser window._

#### Manual Install in Developer Mode
1. Download the ``adnauseam.chromium.ZIP`` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/latest)
2. Extract the zip file to a folder somewhere that it can remain

###### Warning: Do not delete this folder after the install; Chrome will disable AdNauseam if this folder is not in the expected location

3. In your Chrome Browser menu, click Windows > Extensions or type ``chrome://extensions/`` in the address bar
4. Check the ``Developer mode`` checkbox (see image)
5. Click the ``Load unpacked extension`` button (see image) and navigate to the folder you downloaded in step 1<br/>

6. If you have previously exported your ads, you can [retrieve them now](#retrieve-your-saved-data)

<br>

*&nbsp;Note that each time you restart Chrome you will be prompted to ``Disable Developer Mode Extensions``. Feel free to simply hit ``Cancel`` and continue.<br/>

This is indeed annoying, as Google of course intends, however there is no workaround we are aware of at this time

<br>

## Retrieve your saved data

1. After you have AdNauseam up and running again, go back to the AdNauseam settings page
1. Scroll all the way down again and click ''Import Ads''
1. Choose your backup
1. You're all set

## Using AdNauseam on other browsers

If __Google has lost your trust__, as it has ours, you might want to move to a browser that is not as intrusive and controlling. You have a number of options including:

* Go back to [Firefox](https://getfirefox.com), or a derivative like [WaterFox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/)
* You've always wanted to [give Opera a chance](https://opera.com), this is a good excuse
* Try one of the many non-Google versions of Chromium, such as:
    * [Comodo Dragon](https://www.comodo.com/home/browsers-toolbars/browser.php)
    * [Vivaldi](http://www.vivaldi.com/)
    * [Centbrowser](https://www.centbrowser.com/)
