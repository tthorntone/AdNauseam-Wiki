[Google has banned AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/free-adnauseam.html) from its web store and have left users with no access to their data. Follow these instructions to install it anyway.

## Backup your data

_If you're a new AdNauseam user, or don't care about your saved ads, jump to [Installation](#install-adnauseam)_

1. Click on the AdNauseam icon to open the AdNauseam menu
2. Click the ``SETTINGS`` button at the bottom of the menu
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click ``EXPORT ADS``

<br>

## Install AdNauseam

*At the moment Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.) no longer allow add-ons to be installed via drag-and-drop of a `.crx` file. Manual installation is required as described below.*

#### Manual Install in Developer Mode
1. Download the latest [adnauseam-chromium.zip](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/latest/download/adnauseam-chromium.zip) file from the [releases page](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/releases/latest) 
2. Extract the zip file to a folder somewhere where it can remain after install.  
**Warning: Do not delete this folder after the install or the extension will be disabled.**

3. In your Chrome browser menu, click Windows > Extensions or type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar  
4. Make sure the 'Developer Mode' checkbox is ticked
5. Click 'Load unpacked extension' and navigate to the folder you downloaded in step 1. Make sure you select the folder with the name 'adnauseam.chromium'(without a version number). 
6. If you have previously exported your ads, you can retrieve them now  

<br>

*&nbsp;Note that each time you restart Chrome you will be prompted to ``Disable Developer Mode Extensions``. Feel free to simply hit ``Cancel`` and continue.<br/>

This is indeed annoying, as Google intends, however there is a workaround for [advanced users on Windows](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam/wiki/Install-AdNauseam-in-Chrome-on-Windows). Unfortunately we don't know of workarounds (as yet) for other platforms.

<br>

## Retrieve your saved data

1. After you have AdNauseam up and running again, go back to the AdNauseam settings page
1. Scroll all the way down again and click ''Import Ads''
1. Choose your backup
1. You're all set

## Using AdNauseam on other browsers

If __Google has lost your trust__, as it has ours, you might want to move to a browser that is not as intrusive and controlling. You have a number of options including:

* Go back to [Firefox](https://getfirefox.com), or a derivative like [WaterFox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/)
* Try one of the many non-Google versions of Chromium, such as:
    * [Comodo Dragon](https://www.comodo.com/home/browsers-toolbars/browser.php)
    * [Vivaldi](http://www.vivaldi.com/)
    * [Centbrowser](https://www.centbrowser.com/)
