Nightmare mode is when you block everything, except the main document. All secondary resources are blocked. As a result, most sites are broken. I personally advise against using this mode, since there is no real advantages from the [hard mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-hard-mode). If you want to use uBlock Origin in this mode, you are probably better off using [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) or [Policeman](https://github.com/futpib/policeman), which will give you a higher granular control over network requests than what uBlock allows you.
