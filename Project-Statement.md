The AdNauseam project is an open-source initiative with the goal of promoting privacy, specifically as regards the context of advertisement.

The AdNauseam project is dedicated to being a harassment-free, inclusive forum for the sharing of strategies in service of the above goal. Everyone is welcome to contribute, regardless of race, class, gender identity or expression, age, ethnicity, religion, political beliefs, disability, sexual orientation, personal appearance, education level, and other aspects of who we are. In short, this is a space for tolerance and respect.

The AdNauseam project strongly values free speech, but also seeks to ensure no participants are harassed. This includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation, inappropriate or abusive language, stalking or unwelcome sexual attention.

AdNauseam project managers reserve the right to ban anyone from the various forums at any time. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have related concerns, we encourage you to contact a member of the team immediately.
