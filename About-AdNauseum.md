### AdNauseam
#### Clicking Ads So You Donâ€™t Have To

As online advertising becomes more automatic, universal and unsanctioned, AdNauseam works to complete the cycle by automating all ad-clicks on behalf of the target audience. Built atop uBlock Origin, AdNauseam quietly clicks every blocked ad, registering a visit on the ad networks databases. As the data gathered shows an omnivorous click-stream, user profiling, targeting and surveillance becomes futile.

AdNauseam is a browser extension designed to obfuscate browsing data and protect users from surveillance and tracking by advertising networks. Simultaneously, AdNauseam serves as a means of amplifying users' discontent with advertising networks that disregard privacy and facilitate bulk surveillance agendas.

AdNauseam joins a broader class of software systems that serve ethical, political, and expressive ends. In light of the industry's [failure](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/28/do_not_track_w3c_split/) to achieve consensus on a [Do Not Track standard](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track), or to otherwise address the excesses of network tracking, AdNauseam allows individual users to take matters into their own hands, fighting back against excessive unilateral surveillance. Taken in this light, the software follows an approach similar to that of [TrackMeNot](http://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/), employing the obfuscation tactic in an attempt to shift the balance of power between the trackers and the tracked. For further information on this approach, please see this [paper](http://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/resources/trackmenot2009.pdf).
