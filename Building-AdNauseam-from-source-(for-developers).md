#### For Firefox:

  _Note: [Developer](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) builds are now required for development_

1. Open Firefox with the profile you intend to use, then go to ```about:config```, then set ```xpinstall.signatures.required``` to false

2. Make sure you have [jpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jpm) installed

3. In terminal:` $ tools/run-ff.sh`

  _Note: If your Firefox dev version is not in the usual location, you will need to change FIREFOX_BIN in 'tools/run-ff.sh'_

4. (Optional) To use a [Firefox profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles) other than the default, pass the profile path to _run-ff.sh_:

    ````$ tools/run-ff.sh /path/to/profile```` 

5. To view console messages, select the ```Tools->Web Developer->Browser Console``` menu option
